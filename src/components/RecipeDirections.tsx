          Oven method (great for a crowd of six or fewer): Put a rimmed baking
          sheet on the middle rack of the oven and preheat to 450 degrees F.
          Make one sandwich per person: Sandwich 2 slices of cheese between 2
          slices of bread. Spread or brush the outside of the sandwich with 1
          tablespoon of fat. Place on the preheated baking sheet and cook until
          the cheese starts to melt, about 5 minutes. Flip the sandwich and bake
          until golden brown, an additional 5 minutes.{' '}

          Panini press method (for crispy crunchy sandwich that needs minimal
          attention): Sandwich 2 slices of cheese between 2 slices of bread.
          Preheat a panini press to medium heat. Spread or brush the outside of
          the sandwich with 1 tablespoon of fat and place in the press. Close
          the top and cook until lightly browned and the cheese is melted, 5 to
          6 minutes.

          Skillet method (fool-proof and low-tech): Sandwich 2 slices of cheese
          between 2 slices of bread. Preheat a skillet over medium-low heat.
          Spread or brush the outside of the sandwich with 1 tablespoon of fat
          and cook until lightly browned, 3 to 4 minutes. Flip the sandwich, and
          continue cooking until browned and the cheese is melted, 3 to 4
          minutes more.
